Graceful degradation makes it so that even if the website is not fully functioning the way that it should, the computer is still able to maintain some functionality. This allows us to prevent complete failures. ServiceWorkers applies graceful degradation because it stores some data that was collected by the website on your computer so that this data can be used in case of some issue, such as poor network. This allows the website to still function in some ways even if it lacks internet connection.
